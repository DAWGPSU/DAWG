Researchers have acknowledged the potential confounding effects due to sequencing depth and the various problems that arise during the normalization step in microbiome analyses. 
Normalization aims to remove non-biological variation to make samples more equal and correct for minor asymmetries in datasets. Several normalization and transformation steps are employed when performing a differential abundance analyses.
The ALDEx2 R package is a general toolbox for Bayesian modeling of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data. 

In this workshop, Michelle Nixon will be going over some of the features that are offered in ALDEx2.
