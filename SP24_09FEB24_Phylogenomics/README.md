Phylogenomics has advanced our understanding of evolution tremendously. The development of sequencing technology gives us unprecedented insights into the tree of life. In this workshop, we will cover some of the basic concepts pertaining to phylogenomics. We also provide hands-on coding exercises along with a training dataset to infer phylogenies of an ancient microbe. 

Participants are expected to have a basic knowledge of UNIX and will use the command line. Participants are also expected to carry out the analyses on Roar Collab but this is not required. 

All scripts, data, and results for the DAWG workshop can be found in this webpage. The workshop itself will take place on February 9th.
